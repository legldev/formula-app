### About this app

First at all, Thanks for the opportunity to show a little bit my skills. I just want to give you a brief resume of the app.

Basically, the target was create an app that allows to get information about any sports in this particular case i choose the F1. 

I'm using Axios for API calls, but i can handle with "fetch" easily too. The API is provided by RAPIDAPI a service who provides all kind of API with real data.

I used the last version of React Router (v6) which includes some new functionalities to improve the routes on react, this version copies some funcionalities availables on React Navigation used on ReactNative.

Also, for the UI i used MUI (the newest version of Material UI) for React, but obviously, i can bootstrapp all the components from scratch enterely with HTML, styledComponents, etc.

I can keep making some improvements but just want to keep it simple due the time.

Any comments, please don't hesitate to reach me out.
